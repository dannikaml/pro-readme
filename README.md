# Professional README Generator

## Description
***
Using a command-line application to generate/create a README file. 

A high quality README.md should include a detailed description of the project, how to use it, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that others can help with the development of your project. 

## Usage
***
By utilizing Node.js we can create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

In order to install inquirer, please use:

```
npm i inquirer@8.2.4
```

The application will be invoked by using the following command:
```
node index.js
```
